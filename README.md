# Powerautomate Overview
Power Automate, formerly known as Microsoft Flow, is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft that enables users to create workflows and automate business processes. It allows users to create automated workflows that can integrate various apps and services to perform tasks such as data collection, notifications, and process automation.

Power Automate provides a visual interface that allows users to create workflows using a drag-and-drop approach, making it easy for users with limited coding experience to create complex workflows. It supports a wide range of services, including Microsoft services such as SharePoint, Dynamics 365, and Office 365, as well as non-Microsoft services such as Salesforce, Twitter, and Google Drive.

Power Automate includes a range of pre-built templates that users can use to quickly create workflows, and it also allows users to create custom workflows that can be triggered by events such as the creation of a new item in a SharePoint list, a new email arriving in an inbox, or a specific time of day.
